# Sales-Insights-using-Tableau-and-MySQL

This sql dump file is of an imaginary company ATLIQ hardware which does their business in India.
Firstly I did EDA using SQL and after that I imported the dump file into tableau desktop app and cleaned data little bit and prepared a dashboard from the insights I got from EDA.
